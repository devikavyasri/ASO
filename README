ASO: Answer Set Optimization
Answer Set Optimization is an approach for handling preferences in the formalism of logic
programs. Answer Set Optimization consists of a generator program and set of preference rules.


Reference Paper for this software:
On Optimal Solutions of Answer Set Optimization Problems by Ying Zhu, Miroslaw Truszczynski


Implemented Iterative improvement method only. It solves five problems:
1. Find one optimal outcome for ASO program --- optimal
2. Given one optimal outcome, find a different optimal outcome --- diff-Optimal
3. Given one optimal outcome, finding an optimal outcome which is close to given
    outcome by given Hamming distance --- sim optimal
4. Given one optimal outcome, finding an optimal outcome which is close from
    given outcome by given Hamming distance --- dissim optimal
5. Find set of diverse optimal outcomes (three outcomes) -- KDiverse


DataSets:
Generator: Randomly generated 3-CNF formulas with n atoms and 4n clauses

Preference rules:
1. Unranked preference rules:
Randomly generating 3n preference rules without rank (n being as before the number of atoms)

2. Ranked preference rules:
Randomly generating 3n rules with two ranks, half of the rules having rank 1
and half of the rules having rank 2

3. Two LPTrees Preference rules:
Extracting preference rules from two conditional preference LP trees. This results
in a ranked preference program with as many ranks as there are levels in the tree.
The two LP trees considered are equally important.

4. Four LPTrees Preference Rules:
Extracting preference rules from four LP trees with an extra condition that
first LPTree is preferred to other three LP Trees, second LP Tree is preferred to
third and fourth LP Trees and third LP tree is preferred to fourth LPTree.
In experiment, two different sets of four LP Trees are generated.
(a) Four LP Trees with no split
(b) Four LP Trees with one split, which is located at the root node.


Some datasets are in "data" folder. To generate new generator and preference programs,
go to "DataGenerator" folder and see README.



REQUIREMENTS:
Programs are written using Java, AnswerSetProgramming, Shell Scripting.
Required softwares:
clingo (ASP Solver), Java Runtime Environment, Unix Shell Program

This software is tested in macOS.


After downloading the software, go to the folder ASO in terminal.
First compile all Java programs using below command:
javac *.java


USAGE
Eg: sh main.sh 60 4 3 3 2 -1 1 0.2 1

Input: Takes atleast 5 arguments and atmost 9 arguments.

First Argument                 : Number Of Atoms (Atoms shoud be >=3)
Second Argument                : Multiplier for generator Clauses
Third Argument                 : Multiplier for preference Clauses (Enter 0 for LP trees)
Fourth Argument - Problem      : 1 (optimal); 2 (diff-Optimal); 3 (sim/dissim); 4 (KDiverse)
Fifth Argument - PreferenceSet : 1 (unranked) or 2 (ranked) or 3 (TwoLPTrees) 4(FourLPTrees)

Sixth Argument - Type of LP Trees:
  if PreferenceSet == 4: 0 (no split) or 1 (Split at root)
  if PreferenceSet != 4: -1

Seventh Argument - method (if Problem == 3 or 4):
  if problem == 3 (sim/dissim): 1(StraightForward - SF)
                                2 (Alternative - Alt)
                                3(VariantAlternative - Alt_V) \n
  if problem == 4 (KDiverse)  : 1(StraightForward_SF)
                                2 (StraightForward_Alt)
                                3(StraightForward_VAlt)
                                4(Alternative)
                                5(VariantAlternative)

Eighth Argument - distance (if Problem == 3 or 4): 0 to 1
Hamming Distance = distance*NumOfAtoms.
Eg: If NumOfAtoms=10, distance = 0.2 then Hamming Distance = 2.

Ninth Argument - Similar/dissimialar (if Problem == 3): 1(similar) or 2 (dissimilar)\n"
